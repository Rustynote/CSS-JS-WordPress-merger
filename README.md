# CSS JS Queue Merger

For this plugin to work as intended, styles and js must be properly enqueued. Plugin uses style/script handle name combined with version to form a hash which is then used for cache file name. This mean new file will be automatically generated if plugin or theme is updated, this also means if some page requires more or different css/js new file will be generated.

Javascript funcionality is still experimental and it shouldn't be used.
